### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

There are several approaches to writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Often, the best approach is determined beforehand in design meetings with engineers and architects. However, when designing a simple CRUD application that delivers data to a client dashboard, the optimal way to ensure it is maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to use classes and object-oriented programming. This programming paradigm can be utilized by a variety of different programming languages and is an excellent way to standardize the code so engineers can easily navigate and understand how it works.

When reflecting on the work done on the CRUD Python module from Project One, we designed each CRUD function as a method of a larger class. This design approach for the backend made it easy to integrate with client-side code that visualizes the data from Project Two. The main advantages of this approach were that we could easily import the Animal Shelter Model into the client-side code, initialize an instance of the Animal Shelter model, and then have access to all the methods to operate on the data. We dropped in the method where it was needed in different areas of the client code. Overall, it made integrating the server code into the client code as seamless as connecting Lego blocks.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, your approach to problem-solving begins with identifying the issue and gathering any relevant data associated with it. Next, you need to understand the problem and the related data by organizing the information and breaking down the issue into smaller, more manageable parts. Following this, it's time to brainstorm and design a solution based on your analysis. Once a solution is devised, it must be implemented through coding or configuring a software application. However, a computer scientist's work doesn't end with the implementation of a solution. They will then test their solution, identifying issues and areas for improvement to enhance performance. Ultimately, they document their findings throughout the entire problem-solving process, from identifying the problem to testing the solution.

The dashboard requirements from Grazioso Salvare necessitated the application of problem-solving techniques commonly used by computer scientists, especially in analysis. The challenge I faced was integrating an almost complete pre-built webpage, featuring a table, piechart, and map built in Python Dash framework, which I had never worked with before, with the AnimalShelter model. Initially, the page wasn't configured to source its data from the AnimalShelter model, which was crucial for completing project.

Having no prior experience with Python Dash, my initial reaction was confusion over the purpose and function of the existing code. However, by analyzing the code and segmenting it into smaller, related chunks, I began to grasp its mechanics. This deeper understanding of Python Dash's workings was pivotal. It was only after I understood how everything worked with the client code base then could I identify where to integrate the methods provided by the AnimalShelter model to accurately render data in the user interface.

In the future, instead of integrating the AnimalShelter Model directly with client code, I plan to create an API layer for the AnimalShelter Model. By using Flask, I aim to enhance the backend capabilities of the AnimalShelter CRUD model by mapping each CRUD method to a specific API route. The advantage of this strategy is the flexibility it offers in extending and customizing the functionality of each method. For example, with APIs, we can implement authentication middleware to safeguard the CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE methods from unauthorized access. Another benefit is the adaptability it provides regarding client-side technology preferences. Although I have grown fond of Python Dash, it's possible the client may wish to utilize a different client-side technology in the future. With an API layer serving the data, we can easily integrate with a variety of client-side frameworks, such as Angular, React, or Vue. The limitation of our current implementation lies in its direct integration of our model with client code, restricting us to Python-based frameworks.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Typically, computer scientists design software, hardware, and networks. They also create new programming languages, analyze and implement computer algorithms, conduct research experiments to test new theories, upgrade and manage computer systems, and collaborate with other scientists and engineers to create innovative technology.

The work completed on this project has the potential to benefit companies like Grazioso Salvare in terms of data analysis and interpretation. Computer scientists possess the expertise to develop solutions that transform large sets of unorganized data into structured pipelines and visualizations. This enables company owners and stakeholders to extract meaningful insights from the data. Additionally, computer scientists can further refine these data pipelines and visualizations by incorporating machine learning models, thereby enhancing the intelligence applied to the data analysis. The integration of AI for continuous analysis and interpretation elevates the depth and impact of the insights available to company owners and shareholders.
